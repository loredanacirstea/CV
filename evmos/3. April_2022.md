### InterChain Accounts Bridge Demo: 95 h

in-work branches:
- https://github.com/loredanacirstea/ethermint/tree/prototypes/interchain-accounts
- https://github.com/loredanacirstea/evmos/tree/interchain-accounts2

- research ICA
- integrated ICA in evmos - tested interchain bank transfers and it works
- designed ICA precompile in Ethermint, to be used for bridges

```solidity
interface InterchainAccountsPrecompile {
    function emitTx(bytes32 chainId, bool storeResponse, bytes memory input) external returns(bytes memory success);
    function getResponse(bytes32 txHash) view external returns(bytes memory response, bytes memory error);
}
```
- tedious manual testing and debugging, a lot of trial and error work
- integration tests were started
